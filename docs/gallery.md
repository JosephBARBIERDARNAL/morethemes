### Yellowish

The background yellow comes from a nice National Geographic visualisation, and I think it looks pretty cool with the black and white visuals.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import morethemes as mt

mt.set_theme("yellowish")
```

I wanted to make a theme that used the Urbanist font, with a clean professional look. And here it is.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import morethemes as mt

mt.set_theme("urban")
```
